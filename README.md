# SemiMono (WIP)
Colorscheme for Neovim with lower saturation and more "mono"toned in nature.
Be warned, this colorscheme is still in progress and developed at my own lessure, use at your own risk.

## Example
![Basic CPP image example](/img/semimono-cpp.png)

## Installation
LazyVim
```lua
return {
    "Lindenbyte/semimono",
    config = function()
        vim.cmd[[colorscheme semimono]]
    end
}
```

## Attribution
The theme is based on a NvChad base46 theme called Monochrome and a theme by [kvrohit](https://github.com/kvrohit/rasmus.nvim) on github.
